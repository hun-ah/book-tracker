# Book Tracker

This web app is built using Open Library API and utilizes local storage to store all books entered into the search bar.

## How It's Made:
**Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript**

This project was incredibly fun to make! I wanted to start off with creating a book purely made from CSS and animate it to float. I decided to have the book show on screen load and once clicked, would take you to the actual book tracker itself. I added the same floating book on a smaller scale to the tracker itself, to act as a logo. 

The tracker uses Open Library API to retrieve the name of the book. I know it isn't necessarily practical to type in an ISBN number to find a book vs. just typing in a book name and logging the name but I wanted to show case my ability to use an API. The book name is displayed on the screen after clicking the 'add book' button and stored into local storage, so that the page can be revisited after closing the browser and the book names will still be displayed. There are two additional buttons
